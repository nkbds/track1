# Nursing Knowledge Big Data Science 2018

Welcome to “Track 1: Hands-On Full Life Cycle Data Science Workshop” at the [2018 Nursing Knowledge: Big Data Science Conference](https://www.nursing.umn.edu/centers/center-nursing-informatics/news-events/2018-nursing-knowledge-big-data-science-conference-0). In this workshop, you will perform tasks using your laptop to learn data science. To do that, you will use an environment called Jupyter Notebooks. 

To get the most out of the workshop, we are requesting that you come prepared with the environment already installed on your laptop. To do so, you will need to do two things:  
1. Install the Jupyter environment. You have two options:  
    1a. Install the Anaconda distribution (preferred option)  
    1b. Access Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud using Google Colab  
2. Install the Workshop Notebook and Data

### Installing the Anaconda Distribution of Jupyter Notebooks
This is probably the easiest way and the preferred option to get Jupyter Notebook running on your computer. Follow the instructions to install the full Anaconda Distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/download), which includes Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science. Make sure you install the latest Python 3 version of the distribution. Select “Add to Path” option for the Windows global environment variable when prompted.  

After a successful install, you can run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) to start the Jupyter system:
```jupyter notebook```

### Access Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud using Google Colab
You can access Jupyter Notebooks in a shared cloud environment using a Google research project called Colab. This has the advantage of letting you try out a Notebook without having to install anything on your local computer. But the disadvantage is that the session will timeout after 12 hours. It is not suitable for doing real data science work but it could be an option for using it to understand and interact with the Data Science Workshop notebooks. (Note: You will need a Google login to launch the Google colab).  

To access the system, go to the following URL: https://colab.research.google.com/

This will launch a new virtual environment (i.e., in the cloud) where you can play with the Notebooks. Access to the workshop-specific notebook will be provided at the actual event. Ensuring that you have a Google login and that you can access Google Colab is the only pre- work required for this option.

### Installing the Workshop Notebook and Data  
After installing the Jupyter Notebook environment, you can install the Workshop notebook and data. The notebook and data will be made available to participants on Monday, 6/11/18. Please download these files prior to the workshop by getting a command line prompt (CMD on Windows or Terminal on OSX) and execute the following command in a work directory:  
```git clone https://github.com/nkbds/track1```  

This will download the required files to the “track1” directory on your hard drive.
